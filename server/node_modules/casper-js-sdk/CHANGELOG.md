### Added

- **Caution!** This release contains rewritten classes/CLValue/CLType from scratch, there are some breaking changes so consider it before upgrading.

### Changed

- We’ve entirely rewritten the casper-js-sdk from the ground up to provide a more efficient, flexible, and developer-friendly experience. This major release includes significant changes to the SDK’s architecture, type system, and API methods, introducing new types and RPC capabilities to support the latest Casper blockchain features.

## 2.13.0

The first one is string containing hex encoded public key, and the second one is a boolean value that indicates if you want to run checksum validation. When `true` is passed it will throw an error. Otherwise it will log warn to the console. We added this because we want to support users who store the non-checksumed publickeys and need time to adapt
- `AccountHash` now can be serialized to bytes (it's an alias)
- Some internal optimalization (in `matchByteParserByCLType`)

## 2.2.1

### Fixed

- `EventStream` now properly handle invalid JSONs

## 2.2.0

### Added

- `EventStream` added

## 2.1.0

### Fixed

- `state-get-item` due to RPC changes
- `CLList` as empty list initialization from JSON

### Added

- `getBlockTransfers`, `getEraInfoBySwitchBlock`, `getEraInfoBySwitchBlockHeight` methods to `CasperServiceByJsonRPC`

## 2.0.1

### Changed

- `DeployUtil.deployFromJson` returns now `Result<Deploy, Error>` instead of `Deploy | undefined`. `Error` has a `message` inside.

## 2.0.0

### Changed

- Caution! This release contains rewritten CLValue from scratch, there are some breaking changes so consider it before upgrading.
- Removed `CLTypedAndToBytesHelper` to have consistent way of creating new CLValues by using `new CLBool(true)` or `CLValueBuilder.bool(true)`
- Removed `CLTypeHelper` have consistent way of creating new CLValues by using `new CLBoolType()` or `CLTypeBuilder.bool()`
- `CLValue` static methods now are moved to `CLValueBuilder` eg. `CLValueBuilder.u512`
- Every class inheriting from `CLValue` is now named with `CL` prefix, bigger naming changes:
  - `StringValue` -> `CLString`
  - `KeyValue` -> `CLKey`
  - `MapValue` -> `CLMap`
  - `Option` -> `CLOption`
- There are API changes in `CLResult`

```
const myTypesComplex = {
  ok: new CLListType(new CLListType(new CLU8Type())),
  err: new CLOptionType(new CLListType(new CLListType(new CLU8Type())))
};

const myOkComplexRes = new CLResult( Ok(new CLList([new CLList([new CLU8(5), new CLU8(10), new CLU8(15)])])), myTypesComplex );
```

- There are API changes in `CLOption` - now it requires `Some` or `None` wrappers as argument (from `ts-result` library).
- Now all the serialization methods are not connected to `CLValue` anymore - `toJSON`, `fromJSON`, `toBytes`, `fromBytes` needs to be called with `CLValueParsers` eg. `CLValueParser.toJSON(CLValueBuilder.string("ABC"))`
- Renamed methods in `CLPublicKey`:
  - `toAccountHex` -> `toHex` - old name led to misunderstandings as in fact this is hex representation of `public-key` prefixed with key-type.
  - added method `toAccountHashStr` - this methods returns string containing account hash in hex form prefixed with `account-hash-`.
